To properly configure Postgres to be used with Peewee:

$ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev
$ pip install psycopg2  (requirements)

You also have to create a postgres ROLE matching your computer user name (e.g. 'pippo'),
otherwise an exception will be raised:

    peewee.OperationalError: FATAL:  role "pippo" does not exist
